# FlowField
## Student Project

This Project was created druing a school module, called STUWE2. The Goal was to create a Cross Device Animation. 

I did a FlowField with a lot of particles flowing through it. 
You can visit it running on [this website](https://flowfield.herokuapp.com)

There are stil perfomance problems. It works better if it is running local. Because all of the heavy work is done on the server. The client does only draw the vehicles on the points which were calculated by the server.
